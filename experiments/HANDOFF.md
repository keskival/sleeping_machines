# Session handoff — 2026-09-30

Work on `main`. The user authorized committing and pushing all work, wants one
presentable PDF, and intends to start a fresh session. Preserve the established
architecture, theory and historical results; extend them with new evidence.

## Report and publishing

- Canonical PDF: `report/sleeping_machines_status.pdf`; Markdown: `REPORT.md`.
  Regenerate both with `.venv-docker/bin/python report/make_pdf.py`.
- The revision restores all four opening differentiators, explains computation
  through time and counterfactual learning, restores visual comparisons, and
  removes the redundant opening reference table. Complete neural language
  references remain in Appendix B; older revised claims remain in Appendix C.
- Saved text8 test scores: 10M LSTM 1.799, 10M Transformer 1.908, AWS 90M LSTM
  1.661 bpc. Estimated full training costs: 432.59T, 888.78T, 3.89P FLOPs.
- The completed persistent learned-language pilot is 3.351 development bpc,
  28,403 parameters, 8,192 fitting characters and four passes. Estimated event
  arithmetic: 6.962G total fitting FLOPs and 59.741K inference/scoring FLOPs per
  character, with special functions separate. It is not the full benchmark.
- E79's old 1.613/1.504 statistical language headlines had target leakage; E173
  corrects the 10M score to 1.727, or 1.719 with causal word context. Old market
  thresholds used evaluation days. Retain the raw records and stated errors.
- Publishing from this container has been unavailable: origin uses SSH, the
  SSH executable and credentials are absent, and the connected GitHub app
  rejected blob creation with 403. The user has pushed previous commits from
  the host. HTTPS reads work. Verify `git status` and `git log` for the new local
  report commit, then push from an authenticated host. Do not claim it is remote
  until the remote commit is verified.

## Running benchmarks — language now has priority

The user explicitly prioritized the front-page learned-language comparison and
authorized pausing speech. The former suite was stopped without altering model
sources or deleting its logs/checkpoint. A replacement suite runs language first.

- Active tmux: `local_language_priority_20260930T144721Z`.
- Active manifest: `experiments/queue/local_language_priority_20260930T144721Z.json`.
- Active suite log: `experiments/queue/local_language_priority_20260930T144721Z.out`.
- Current guarded job: `local_full_proper_language_10m_20260930T131028Z`, using
  its original unique queue and unchanged configuration. It started at 14:47 UTC.
- Speech resumes after language from epoch 12, example 6,144; source hashes in
  `local_full_proper_shd_20260930T131028Z.progress.pt` were checked before pausing.
- Remaining order: speech, DVS, MNIST, market, temporal composition.
- The user will push incremental commits from the authenticated host; commit
  reviewed report work on `main`. The references-only front-page panel has been
  replaced by completed order-learning and retrieval comparisons. Keep the
  larger language claim pending until the actual result and full work exist.

### Original suite record (superseded)

- Former tmux: `proper_events_20260930T131028Z` (stopped).
- Manifest: `experiments/queue/local_full_proper_suite_20260930T131028Z.json`.
- Historical suite log: `experiments/queue/local_full_proper_suite_20260930T131028Z.out`.
- One guarded job at a time, through `experiments/queue/run_safe.sh`; never
  launch Python training directly. Current job: full SHD, 20 epochs, seed 6,
  from scratch, 395,814 learned parameters, 6,987 fit / 1,169 development
  utterances. At this handoff it had reached epoch 11. Official test runs once
  after development selection; ongoing development scores are not final tests.
- Next jobs, serially: DVS, MNIST, market, temporal composition, learned
  language. The language job has six layers, width 256, 128 temporal modes,
  1,205,805 parameters; 10M fit characters, four passes, 200K development and
  the existing 1M test interval. No count/copy/word experts.
- CPU-only host. Suite caps: virtual memory 4,000,000 KiB, RSS 2,500,000 KiB,
  minimum available memory 8,192 MiB, timeout 864,000 seconds. Available memory
  at handoff was about 11.2 GiB and only one training process was active.
- Progress/checkpoints are ignored local files under `experiments/results/`.
  Final result JSONs are versioned. Check the live state before deciding whether
  a job needs resumption; the queue and tmux process may still be running.
- Do not train Transformers or LSTMs here. The user reserves new dense controls
  for AWS; reuse existing reference results. Update the report from completed
  comparable results without deleting older evidence.

The model drivers and theory were not changed by this report revision. The
source hashes recorded by the running suite remain its reproducibility contract.
