**M21 (debug size) — can the hidden layer learn without labels?** A label-free competitive
rule (winners move toward their input, rows normalised, homeostasis) with the same output
learning reached 0.29 (η 0.02) and 0.20 (η 0.1) on 2k images, *below* a frozen random hidden
layer (0.33); fired-only credit, which uses labels, reached 0.56. *Learned:* this **contradicts**
the M3 reading below. Label information in the hidden update matters a lot, even though its
alignment with the true gradient, measured at one late snapshot, is weak. Likely reconciliation:
weak local alignment that is consistent over training (M3 measures one point on a pretrained
network). *Next:* M21 at full size (queued); measure alignment along training, not only after it.

**M18 — history repair, full size (small network, 10k images, 3 epochs, seed 0).**
Repair 0.749 vs counterfactual credit 0.818 and fired-only 0.823, while changing 46× fewer
weights (0.27M vs 12.6M). Hidden repairs add ~9 points over output-only repair (0.655).
*Learned:* single-event repair is a real hidden-layer learning signal and extremely sparse, but
not yet competitive on accuracy. The baselines also learn on thin margins and run homeostasis;
repair did neither. *Next:* M18b adds both (queued), then multi-step delegation.

**M13 — learning by half-space projection (single layer, validation).** 7 settings end at
0.899–0.905 after 5 epochs vs 0.909 for the near-miss rule. Needs a minimum correction
deadline (c ≥ 0.2–0.5), because decisions made at the first instant leave no charge to act
on, and a capped step (PA-I); without them it diverges (0.25). *Learned:* a valid
reformulation with no learning rate, not an improvement. The half-space property is also known
(RELATED_WORK.md). *Next:* keep it as the geometric core of repair, not as a rule of its own.

**M19 (debug size only).** After fixing a capped-time bug, the exact gradient of a
cross-entropy over output firing times barely aligns with the gradient of expected *error*
(−0.03 vs +0.61 for the E6 rule), at a size where the estimate is unreliable. *Hypothesis:* the
cross-entropy pushes confident samples too, while error only moves near boundaries. Full size
queued.

**M3 — does each rule point downhill? (3 seeds, 200 coordinates, estimate reliability
0.74–0.80 hidden, 0.95–0.99 output).** Output rule: +0.36 to +0.73. Hidden rules: random
feedback ≈ +0.05, fired-only ≈ −0.01, true-weight feedback ≈ +0.21, sign feedback ≈ +0.17.
Only 13–25% of hidden weights have any nonzero true gradient, rising with timing noise.
*Learned:* at this snapshot, hidden credit carries little gradient information, which fits
counterfactual and fired-only credit tying. (An earlier reading, that the hidden layer's gain
comes from its own competition and homeostasis, is contradicted by M21 above.)
The zero-gradient majority is the blind spot that motivates the tree-of-histories view (§14).

**E9 P1 — cascade.** Only 0.07% of work happens after the output decides. *Learned:* the cost
sits before the decision; only sparse fan-in and routing can reduce it.

**E6 round-3 controls.** Single layer 0.921, frozen hidden 0.895, counterfactual 0.959,
fired-only 0.961, hidden 2000 0.960. *Learned:* depth adds ~4 points under round-3 settings;
the new synapse model gave the single layer ~2.5; width and credit type add nothing.

**Energy re-check.** Round-3 hidden networks: ~108k synaptic events per image, ~3.6× the
inference energy of an equally accurate 32-unit MLP; training 1.2–1.5× cheaper than unbatched
dense training. Only the single racing layer wins at inference (~2.4×).

**Engineering.** Parallel runs hung the host twice; logs could not say why. Everything now runs
one job at a time with a watchdog. Hidden batch assumptions surfaced when moving to one frame
per update (homeostasis inside `teach`; a frame with no hidden spike). A waiter loop that
matched its own command line never started the queue; found by checking, not assuming.
